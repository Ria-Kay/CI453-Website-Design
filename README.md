# CI453-Website-Design
A basic navigational webpage with room for informational text

This website was created as a part of my course, we were required to collectively design and create an informative internet safety website for children.
For my part I created this empty website  for my teammates, following their specifications to make sure the website matched their needs. This included having dedication sections for informative text and links to a quiz page to engage the users.

Following these queues, I created a parallax scrolling site with dedicated sections on each panel. One reason for this was by having the text broken into small sections, it would be more digestible for the target demographic. As well as by having the many different panels we were able to tell a story in the background, with the users venturing further into space as they scrolled.

It was designed mostly using HTML and CSS, with only few componets using JS.
The navigation elemement was one of these java script components, using a minimal design in order to not distract from the body of the site, the text, whilst providing a quick way to jump between each block.

The background images were sourced from the open image site unsplash.com.
The final text and quiz have been removed to only present my own work.
